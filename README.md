# Assessment Starter Project

You must start your 2nd assessments for both Software Development Skills 2 (CM6123/CM6623) and Fundamentals of Computing with Java (CM6121/CM6621) from here.

You will submit the SAME Gitlab URL to both assessments.

You will be judged on different aspects of the same work - just like the group projects, but submitted individually.

Use the same routine as for SDS2's 1st assessment.

* Fork the project
* Clone it
* Make sure it works
* Remove the fork relationship (see Advanced under the Settings menu)
* Make the repository private
* Add myself, Helene and Tingting as maintainers.
